  User session and verification tokens.

  ## Token Types (contexts)

  Different token types are used for different purposes:

  - `"session"` — Session tokens (14-day validity)
    - Stored raw in database (already signed by Phoenix)
    - Used to maintain user sessions
    - Checked on every HTTP request and LiveView connection
    - Automatically reissued after 7 days of use

  - `"login"` — Magic link tokens (15-minute validity)
    - Sent to user's email for authentication
    - Hashed in database for security
    - Confirms unconfirmed accounts
    - One-time use

  - `"change: {email}"` — Email change verification (7-day validity)
    - Sent to NEW email address for verification
    - Hashed in database
    - One-time use

  - `"reset_password"` — Password reset tokens (7-day validity)
    - For password reset flows
    - Hashed in database

  ## Security Notes

  - Magic link tokens (15 minutes) are short-lived because email access = account access
  - Session tokens (14 days) are valid for two weeks before requiring re-login
  - Token reissue happens automatically: users with 7+ day old tokens get new ones
  - Hashed tokens in database prevent read-only DB access from compromising tokens
  - Unconfirmed users with passwords cannot use magic links (prevents mixing auth methods)

  ## Token Storage

  Session tokens are stored raw (not hashed) because:
  - They're already signed by Phoenix's session mechanism
  - Faster verification (no hashing needed)
  - Can be expired individually by deleting from DB
  - Phoenix signs/verifies the token signature

  Email tokens are hashed because:
  - They travel in URLs/emails (less protected)
  - Hash stored in DB prevents read-only DB access from compromising them
  - One-way function means token can't be reconstructed from database

  ## Authenticated At Field

  The `authenticated_at` timestamp:
  - Set to user's login time when session token created
  - Allows sudo mode validation: checks if user authenticated within ~10 minutes
  - Used to enforce re-authentication for sensitive operations

  Generates a token that will be stored in a signed place,
  such as session or cookie. As they are signed, those
  tokens do not need to be hashed.

  The reason why we store session tokens in the database, even
  though Phoenix already provides a session cookie, is because
  Phoenix's default session cookies are not persisted, they are
  simply signed and potentially encrypted. This means they are
  valid indefinitely, unless you change the signing/encryption
  salt.

  Therefore, storing them allows individual user
  sessions to be expired. The token system can also be extended
  to store additional data, such as the device used for logging in.
  You could then use this information to display all valid sessions
  and devices in the UI and allow users to explicitly expire any
  session they deem invalid.

  Builds a token and its hash to be delivered to the user's email.

  The non-hashed token is sent to the user email while the
  hashed part is stored in the database. The original token cannot be reconstructed,
  which means anyone with read-only access to the database cannot directly use
  the token in the application to gain access. Furthermore, if the user changes
  their email in the system, the tokens sent to the previous email are no longer
  valid.

  Users can easily adapt the existing code to provide other types of delivery methods,
  for example, by phone numbers.
